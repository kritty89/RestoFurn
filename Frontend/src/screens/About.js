          <h5>Why consider sustainable furniture?</h5>
          <p>Furniture is often made from natural resources like wood — and when mass produced has devastating deforestation 
            and greenhouse emission impacts. Mindfully selecting sustainable furniture when elevating your space takes the environment 
            into consideration, as sustainable furniture uses eco-friendly materials like reclaimed wood, recycled materials, and bamboo, 
            limiting the need for sourcing new materials. Sustainable furniture is also most often made without toxic materials and harmful 
            chemicals like VOCs, allowing you to keep the health of your indoor environment in check. Because furniture is a long-term 
            investment, it’s even more important to consider sustainable furniture pieces that are ethically and responsibly made, as they can 
            make a significant difference for our homes, our families, and the planet.</p>
